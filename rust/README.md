Welcome to the Docker Init CLI!

This utility will walk you through creating the following files with sensible defaults for your project:
  - .dockerignore
  - Dockerfile
  - compose.yaml

Let's get started!

WARNING: The following Docker files already exist in this directory:
  - .dockerignore

? Do you want to overwrite them? Yes
? What application platform does your project use? Rust
? What version of Rust do you want to use? 1.70.0
? What port does your server listen on? 3030

CREATED: .dockerignore
CREATED: Dockerfile
CREATED: compose.yaml

âœ” Your Docker files are ready!

Take a moment to review them and tailor them to your application.

When you're ready, start your application by running: docker compose up --build

Your application will be available at http://localhost:3030
```
